    <h1>All about cats!</h1>
    
    <h2>Basic info</h2>
    
    <p> The domestic cat is a small, typically furry, carnivorous mammal. 
        They are often called house cats when kept as indoor pets or simply cats when there 
        is no need to distinguish them from other felids and felines. Cats are often valued 
        by humans for companionship and for their ability to hunt vermin. There are more than 
        70 cat breeds, though different associations proclaim different numbers according to their standards.</p>
