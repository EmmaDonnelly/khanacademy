        <h1>Travel to Hawaii</h1>
        
        <p>Hawaii's diverse natural scenery, <em>warm</em> tropical climate, abundance of public beaches, oceanic surroundings, and active volcanoes make it <strong>a popular destination for tourists, surfers, biologists, and volcanologists</strong>. Because of its central location in the Pacific and 19th-century labor migration, Hawaii's culture is strongly influenced by North American and Asian cultures, in addition to its indigenous Hawaiian culture. Hawaii has over a million permanent residents, along with many visitors and U.S. military personnel. Its capital is Honolulu on the island of Oʻahu.</p>

    <h2>Volcanoes</h2>    
    <p>The Hawaiian islands were formed by volcanic activity initiated at an undersea magma source called the Hawaii hotspot. The process is continuing to build islands; the tectonic plate beneath much of the Pacific Ocean continually moves northwest and the hot spot remains stationary, slowly creating new volcanoes. Because of the hotspot's location, all currently active land volcanoes are located on the southern half of Hawaii Island. The newest volcano, Lōʻihi Seamount, is located south of the coast of Hawaii Island.<br><br>Some volvanoes found in Hawaii include:</p>
